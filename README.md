# Admission Predictor --> Linear Regression Algorithm
Predicts the admission chances with the help of given dataset with the help of Linear Regression Algorithm.
https://admission-predictor.onrender.com/

How the Project Works -->

1. The dataset is loaded and preprocessed.

2. Linear Regression model is trained on the data.

3. The trained model is saved as a .pickle file.

4. A Flask web app loads the model and accepts user inputs.

5. The model predicts the admission probability based on the inputs.
